## Prerequisites and must-have items and software!

Hello! You can definitely get started on arduino without any special background whatsoever (I'll work you through, promise), but there are certain little somethings that will make things just a little easier for you! For starters, a solid background in basic electronics (like Ohm's Law -- but I'll try my best to explain that as well as I can too) and basic programming knowledge (``in C! Viva CS50!``) helps A LOT. 
Here I'll try to list some things that you will need, explanations as to WHY you need them

## Hardware

* A computer with internet access
* An arduino board, cables, LEDs, a breadboard, etc
* A rubber duck or any other inanimate object that works for you (I will explain, read on)
* Any arduino shields etc you wish to utilise

## Concerning #2:      
Feel free to opt for an arduino kit, they're pretty neat and they will help you get started right off the bat! Some of them come with project instructions as well!

## Concerning #2:  

If you can't buy any hardware--don't fret! There are plenty decent arduino simulators out there for you to learn the ropes without spending any of your hard-earned money on something you don't know if you'll enjoy enough to stick with! (relevant link in description)

## Concerning #3:  
Carefully place the rubber duck next to you. Explain your code. Yell at it when you get frustrated. ``Trust me, it just works.``


## Software:

If you cannot afford hardware, click the link in the comments for the appropriate masterpost. 
The arduino IDE ! You can download it for free [here](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) 

That's it for now! I'll edit this later if I think of something new! Suggestions and questions are always welcome.
