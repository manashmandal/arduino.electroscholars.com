# How to contribute? 

Are you new to GitHub? Know a lot of things and found a lot of error in our documents but can't help us out? Then you are on the right page! This should be a simple tutorial on how to contribute to this git-based crowd source project. People who are having a hard time with GitHub now can finally contribute

## Step 1
Create a new account on `github` by just visiting [here](https://github.com)

## Step 2
* You have created your account and verified it so you'll be able to contribute to any project on the github now 
* Since you are reading this page for contributing to this Arduino project so just visit [this link](https://github.com/manashmndl/arduino.electroscholars.com) and click `fork`.

* Take a look at the forked copy

> Forking means you now own a copy of the website in your account, so you don't have to search here and there for the project link. Just login to your account for contributing next time(s) 

## Step 3

* Well what do you know? Now you can add as many information as you wish! Neat, huh? 
* To get started, let's see how to add a page to this website! Click on the `+` sign to begin

## Step 4

* Name your precious file! [Don't forget to add `.md` extension for markdown!]. Then write something.

* Lot to do? I agree, but only for the first time, from the next time(s) it will by easy as pie. 
* Now simply add some comments "bla bla bla" and push the `Commit New File` button and it will be done before you know it

## Step 5
> You have created the file in your own forked repo! That does not mean that I and others who have forked this project have the copy of your file you just created! Then how will you notify me and others that you have added a file or corrected a mistake?

* Good thing GitHub has pull request! Click on the `Pull Request`Link
![pull](http://i.imgur.com/qQJmlSy.png)

* Click `New Pull Request`
![pull2](http://i.imgur.com/Z4sUUHd.png)

* Yeah Yeah, click `Create Pull Request`
![pullconfirm](http://i.imgur.com/XUBsBin.png)

* Add some message about your edit/creation :wink:

## Step 6

You have created a file but it is not in the menu! If you want to show your file on the website, make sure you edit the `SUMMARY.md` file to put the link of the document you just have made. Here is an example.

#### Done!!! 

If you visit [this link](http://arduino.electroscholars.com) then you'll see

## Now from my side

* I get a notification that you have created a file and want to merge it with the original repo. I simply accept it and merge it with my repo.

## Don't Forget!!!

Don't you want credit for the awesome contribution you just made? Sure you do, even if you don't we insist to add your name to the contributors' page. The more the merrier. People will be wanting to contribute if they see a lot of people working hard to make a vision into reality. We would like you to be with us!

Add your name to the `contributors.md` file and send pull request.
